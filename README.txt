FRAUD DETECTION – CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS


PROJECT OVERVIEW

Machine Learning (ML) Project designed to detect fraudulent credit card transactions utilizing interpretable models. The dataset used is Kaggle's "Credit Card Fraud Detection". This dataset is highly imbalanced (only less than 1% of the data are labelled as fraudulent). This poses a significant challenge due to majority-class bias, requiring careful handling of imbalance and tuning of hyperparameters.

EVALUATION METRICS

Given the nature of the dataset (class imbalance), evaluation focuses on:

- Precision-Recall AUC (AUPRC)
- F1-score
- Recall (sensitivity to fraud cases)
