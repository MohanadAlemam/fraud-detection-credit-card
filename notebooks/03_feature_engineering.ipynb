    "| Features with non-overlapping medians | `V4, V9, V10, V11, V12, V14, V16, V17` | These features already show good separation between classes, i.e., they tend to occupy different ranges. Transformations can **enhance this separation** and make the difference between classes clearer. | Squaring or square root transformation |\n",
    "| Highly concentrated (low variance) features | `V2, V5, V7, V8, V20, V21, V23, V27, V28, Amount` | Low variance features may be ignored by models sensitive to variance (e.g., linear models). Scaling ensures these features are **considered during training**. | MinMaxScaler |\n",
    "| Multimodal feature | `Time` | Multiple peaks suggest subtle sub-patterns. Engineering can **capture hidden patterns**. | - Feature extraction: hour of day, day segment <br> - Binning into categories (morning/afternoon/evening/night) |\n",
    "| Heavy-tailed / skewed features | `V1` (skewed to the left) | Outliers could dominate learning, especially for linear models. Transformation reduces the effect of extreme values and **stabilizes the feature**. | - Log-transform <br> - Square root or power transformation |\n"
